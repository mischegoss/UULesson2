<!--This is from our review of local storage. Local storage is a way to keep
short pieces of information but it does not persist.

LocalStorage

Stores data with no expiration date, and gets cleared only through JavaScript, or clearing the Browser cache / Locally Stored Data
Storage limit is the maximum amongst the three
SessionStorage

The sessionStorage object stores data only for a session, meaning that the data is stored until the browser (or tab) is closed.
Data is never transferred to the server.
Storage limit is larger than a cookie (at least 5MB).

You may want to use these sometimes but you can see how Firebase would be better.

For example, you want your users to be able to exit and log back in and have them remembered
